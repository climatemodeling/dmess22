### Workshop Co-conveners

 * <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.climatemodeling.org/~forrest/"><b>Forrest
M. Hoffman</b></a> is a Distinguished Computational Earth System Scientist at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (ORNL). As a resident researcher in ORNL's Climate Change Science
Institute (CCSI) and a member of ORNL's Computational Sciences & Engineering Division
(CSED), Forrest develops and applies Earth system models (ESMs) to investigate the global
carbon cycle and feedbacks between biogeochemical cycles and the climate system. He applies
data mining methods using high performance computing to problems in landscape ecology,
remote sensing, and large-scale climate data analytics. He founded the workshop series on Data
Mining in Earth System Science (DMESS) in 2009 and has served as lead convener for all six
prior workshops. Forrest is also a Joint Faculty Professor in the University of Tennessee's
Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering in nearby Knoxville, Tennessee.

 * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.climatemodeling.org/~jkumar/"> <b>Jitendra Kumar</b></a>
is a computational hydrologist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
and a Joint Assistant Professor at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville. He conducts research at the intersection of high performance
computing, environmental and Earth sciences, and systems analysis
and data mining. His research entails data mining, large-scale global
optimization, computational hydrology and hydrogeology, landscape ecology,
remote sensing, and development of parallel algorithms for large-scale
supercomputers.

 * <a target="_blank" href="https://sarats.com/"><b>Sarat
Sreepathi</b></a> is a Computer Scientist interested in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of High Performance Computing and domain sciences. He is a member of the Computational Earth Sciences Group in the Computational Sciences and Engineering Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University. He is a Senior member of ACM and IEEE. He served as the Chair of the OLCF User Group Executive Board (2020-2021) and currently serves on the NERSC User Group Executive Committee.
He co-leads the Performance group for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project, DOE's flagship climate modeling effort. He leads application co-design efforts as a member of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) application teams (Climate: E3SM-MMF and Nuclear Fusion: XGC).
