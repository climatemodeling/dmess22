          <h1>Eleventh Workshop on Data Mining in Earth System Science (DMESS 2022)</h1>
<h3>Co-conveners: <a href="http://www.climatemodeling.org/~forrest/">Forrest M. Hoffman</a>, <a href="http://www.climatemodeling.org/~jkumar/">Jitendra Kumar</a>, <a href="http://sarats.com/">Sarat Sreepathi</a></h3>
<h4>In conjunction with the <a href="https://icdm22.cse.usf.edu">IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2022)</a></h4>
<h4>Sorrento, Italy — November 17, 2020</h4>

<p>Spanning many orders of magnitude in time and space scales, Earth science data, from point measurements to process-based Earth system model output, are increasingly large and complex, and often represent very long time series, making these data difficult to analyze, visualize, interpret, and understand. An “explosion” of heterogeneous, multi-disciplinary data—including observations and models of interacting natural, engineered, and human systems—have rendered traditional means of integration and analysis ineffective, necessitating the application of new analytical methods and the development of highly scalable software tools for synthesis, assimilation, comparison, and visualization. For complex, nonlinear feedbacks among chaotic processes, new methods and approaches for data mining and computational statistics are required for classification and change detection, model evaluation and benchmarking, uncertainty quantification, and incorporation of constraints from physics, chemistry, and biology into analysis. This workshop explores various data mining approaches and algorithms for understanding nonlinear dynamics of weather and climate systems and their interactions with biogeochemical cycles, impacts of natural system responses and climate extremes on engineered systems and interdependent infrastructure networks, and mitigation and adaptation strategies for natural hazards and infrastructure and ecosystem resilience. Encouraged are original research papers describing applications of statistical and data mining methods that support analysis and discovery in climate predictability, attributions, weather extremes, water resources management, risk analysis and hazards assessment, ecosystem sustainability, infrastructure resilience, and geo-engineering.</p>

<p>Rigorous review papers that either have the potential to expose data mining researchers to commonly used data-driven methods in the Earth sciences or discuss the applicability and caveats of such methods from a machine learning or statistical perspective, are also desired. Methods may include, but are not limited to cluster analysis, empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), extreme value and rare events analysis, genetic algorithms, neural networks and deep learning methods, physics-constrained data analytics, automated data assimilation, and other machine learning techniques. Novel approaches that bring new ideas from nonlinear dynamics and information theory, network science and graphical methods, and the state-of-the-art in computational statistics and econometrics, into data mining and machine learning, are particularly encouraged.</p>

<hr />
<p>All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to scope of the workshop, originality, significance, and clarity. The following sections give further information for authors.</p>

<h4>Triple blind submission guidelines</h4>

<p>Since 2011, ICDM has imposed a triple blind submission and review policy for all submissions. Authors must hence not use identifying information in the text of the paper and bibliographies must be referenced to preserve anonymity. Any papers available on the Web (including Arxiv) no longer qualify for ICDM submissions, as their author information is already public.</p>

<h4>What is triple blind reviewing?</h4>

<p>The traditional blind paper submission hides the referee names from the authors, and the double-blind paper submission also hides the author names from the referees. The triple-blind reviewing further hides the referee names among referees during paper discussions before their acceptance decisions. The names of authors and referees remain known only to the PC Co-chairs, and the author names are disclosed only after the ranking and acceptance of submissions are finalized. It is imperative that all authors of ICDM submissions conceal their identity and affiliation information in their paper submissions. It does not suffice to simply remove the author names and affiliations from the first page, but also in the content of each paper submission.</p>

<h4>How to prepare your submissions</h4>

<p>The authors shall omit their names from the submission. For formatting templates with author and institution information, simply replace all these information in the template by “Anonymous”.</p>

<p>In the submission, the authors’ should refer to their own prior work like the prior work of any other author, and include all relevant citations. This can be done either by referring to their prior work in the third person or referencing papers generically. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on clustering, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on distance-based clustering (Smith 2005),” you might say “We extend Smith’s (Smith 2005) earlier work on distance-based clustering.” The authors shall exclude citations to their own work which is not fundamental to understanding the paper, including prior versions (e.g., technical reports, unpublished internal documents) of the submitted paper. Hence, do not write: “In our previous work [3]” as it reveals that citation 3 is written by the current authors. The authors shall remove mention of funding sources, personal acknowledgments, and other such auxiliary information that could be related to their identities. These can be reinstituted in the camera-ready copy once the paper is accepted for publication. The authors shall make statements on well-known or unique systems that identify an author, as vague in respect to identifying the authors as possible. The submitted files shall be named with care to ensure that author anonymity is not compromised by the file name. For example, do not name your submission “Smith.pdf”, instead give it a name that is descriptive of the title of your paper, such as “ANewApproachtoClustering.pdf” (or a shorter version of the same).</p>

<p>Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to allow reproducibility. This includes experimental methodology, empirical evaluations, and results. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available whenever possible. In addition, authors are strongly encouraged to also report, whenever possible, results for their methods on publicly available datasets.</p>

<p>All manuscripts are submitted as full papers and are reviewed based on their scientific merit. There is no separate abstract submission step. There are no separate industrial, application, short paper or poster tracks during submission.</p>
